## Description

STCV Synth is a project that consists in controlling a music synthesizer DSP engine using the SensorTile (ST) and Computer Vision (CV). The synthesizer will have two main elements: a generator and controllers.

The generator is the DSP engine, which is built using the Python library Pyo or the C synthesizer CSound.

The controller elements are the ST and CV.

The ST will be sending continuous data to operate specific parameters of the synthesizer, such as amplitude and filter frequency. This data will most likely be obtained from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and barometer. The data will be transferred to the computer hosting the engine via BLE.

The host computer will also need a camera to run the CV controller, which will be used to register the amount of fingers displayed in the camera's field of view to play that number of different notes. Additionally, sign-language gestures wil be used as triggers to control special events for the synthesizers, such as turning DSP effects on and off, such as delays or reverbs.

The program will be able to be run from a computer or from an embedded system such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano.


## Objectives

The project's objectives are to:

* Provide alternative ways of creative musical expression through the use of Wearables and Computer Vision
* Implement an audio synthesizer generator using the Python Pyo library, created by Olivier BÃ©langer.
* Setup controllers for interfacing with this generator, specifically:
    * Employ machine learning and computer vision to provide trigger and switch gestures.
    * Utilize SensorTile via BLE to provide continuous controller data.
* Run project on an embedded system, namely the NVIDIA Jetson Nano (4GB version), for portability


## Equipment Required

The required equipment includes:

* SensorTile:
    * [SensorTile Development Kit](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-stlkt01v1.html)
        * *Note: Solder SensorTile to the Cradle board for operating it as a wearable*
