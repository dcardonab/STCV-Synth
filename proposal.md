# Final Project Proposal

## Notes to keep in mind (DELETE BEFORE SUBMITTING)

* The project apply any of the knowledge presented in class or related (CV, ML and AI as example), and it is referenced in the proposal
* The project does not require very expensive equipment
* The project has a future application in real life
* The project stays away of any possible ethics and privacy issues and it is intended to improve human life
* The project does not compromise the safety of any member of the team at any time
* The project delivered should demonstrate the process of design, testing and proving the concept of the idea proposed.

## Description


## Objectives

The project's objectives are to:

* Provide alternative ways of creative musical expression through the use of Wearables and Computer Vision
* Implement an audio synthesizer generator using the Python Pyo library, created by Olivier BÃ©langer.
* Setup controllers for interfacing with this generator, specifically:
    * Employ machine learning and computer vision to provide trigger and switch gestures.
    * Utilize SensorTile via BLE to provide continuous controller data.
* Run project on an embedded system, namely the NVIDIA Jetson Nano (4GB version), for portability
