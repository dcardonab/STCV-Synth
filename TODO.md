# TODO

## Jetson Nano

* Install and test `bleak` in Jetson Nano.

* Verify automatic selection of `defualt` audio driver when initializing.

* Verify installation process.


## Documentation

* Verify installation instructions in README.

* Add user manual, including description and usage instructions.


## ST

* Implement 'Sustain' mode of operation. (Determine how to start and stop notes. Perhaps a tapping gesture?)

* Add polyphonic control. (`Voice` class abstraction?)


## CV

* Optimize performance

* Use the ST wearing hand menu to only detect the other hand for polyphony, and the ST hand for GUI operation.


## GUI

* Gray out plus and minus buttons when the current value is equal to the minimum or maximum.
